Important C++ Lessons:
- Always add variable names in header files.
- Always comment headers, not cpp files.
- Can have default parameters in C++
- Should try to implement smart pointers (automatically destroyed) - Boost 
- Try to only pass const items by reference, otherwise pass pointer.
- Don't worry too much about const - it's quite misleading (you can still modify things that you call const). However can make a method
const if it doesn't alter itself.
