Can you break an Enigma encoding?

Lazy.enc and Message.enc are both outputs from an Enigma machine from two
unknown inputs.  The machine was set up identically in both cases.  

It had 3 rotors (of unknown configuration), and some plugboard wiring.

If you can decrypt Message.enc, email it decrypted to tora@doc.ic.ac.uk.
